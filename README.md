# Expo Camera Preview Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Expo's Camera API with custom styling. The camera preview fails to render correctly, appearing distorted, hidden, or overlapping other UI elements.

The problem is investigated and a solution is provided.

## Bug Report

The issue arises from a conflict between the camera's internal layout and user-applied styles.  This can result in unexpected behavior and a broken user experience.

## Solution

The solution involves careful consideration of the camera's styling properties and ensuring that they don't interfere with the preview's rendering process.  This often involves adjusting flexbox properties, z-indices, or using specific styling approaches to work harmoniously with the Camera component.
